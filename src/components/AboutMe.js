          My name is William Valido and welcome to my portfolio! I am dedicated
          full stack developer with a focus on React.js for frontend and
          proficiency in FastAPI, Express.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL for the
          backend. I started coding at a young age and pursued a Computer
          Science degree at FIU. I thrive on the ever-evolving tech landscape
          and the collaborative developer community that drives innovation in
          web development. Beyond coding, I cherish spending time with my wife
          and four-legged friend, as well as staying active. In the future, I
          aim to work with multiple clients to contribute my expertise to their
          digital success.
